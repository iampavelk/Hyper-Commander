Stage 1 Menu first

Description
First thing first. To use your program, you need a menu. Now, create the menu for your program by following the objectives below.

Objectives
Print the welcome message Hello current-user. Don't forget to replace current-user with the value stored in the USER environment variable;
Print the menu;
Wait for user input;
If the user input is listed but not 0, print Not implemented!
If the user input is not listed, print Invalid option!
If the user input is 0, print Farewell! and end the program, or else start over.
Use the code snippet below for the main menu.

------------------------------

| 0: Exit                    |
| 1: OS info                 |

Stage 2 Who am I?

Description
Let's start with a relatively simple task. Implement the menu item 1 and 2 by following the objectives below.

Objectives
Print the main menu like in the previous step and wait for the user input;
If the user input is 1, print operating system and node name with the help of the uname command;
If the user input is 2, print the user information with the help of the whoami command;
If input contains anything else than the above, keep the functionality from the previous step;

Stage 3 Files and directories

Description
Time to add some functionality to the menu item 3. Your task is to list the files and directories in the current location.

Objectives
Print the main menu as in the previous steps and wait for the user input;
If the user input is 3, print The list of files and directories:
List the files and directories by following the structure defined in the next line. First, print the type of the listed item (F for files and D for directories), and then the name of the listed item;
Print the file menu and wait for user input:
If the user input is up, print Not implemented!;
If the user input is a file or directory name, print Not implemented!;
If the user input is 0, return to the main menu;
If anything else, print Invalid input! and start over.
If input contains anything else than the above, keep the functionality from the previous steps.
Use the code snippet below for the file menu.

---------------------------------------------------
| 0 Main menu | 'up' To parent | 'name' To select |
---------------------------------------------------

Use globbing to convert file and directory names to an array:

arr=(*)

You can also use a loop to test if an item is a file or directory:

for item in "${arr[@]}"; do
  if [[ -f "$item" ]]; then
    echo "do something"
  elif [[ -d "$item" ]]; then
    echo "do something else"
  fi
  echo "do another thing"
done

If the user input is a file name, print Not implemented!;
If the user input is 0, return to the main menu;
If anything else, print Invalid input! and start over.
